- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable code. It's not just about making it work, but also about making it easy for others (and your future self) to understand and modify. Invest time in planning and designing your code, use meaningful variable names, write comments to explain complex logic, and follow consistent formatting. This will not only make your code more readable and easier to debug, but also save time and effort in the long run."
